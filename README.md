## Release Automation Playground

This is a temporary repo to experiment with release automation.

The goal is to refine the release automation process before implementing it in the [parse-server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) repository. This is part of the effort to implement [fixed release cycles](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/7271).

The expected outcomes are:
- Definition of new GitHub labels
- Definition of new forward looking branch strucure to collect breaking changes to next major release
- Definition of new changelog design to for auto-update compatibility
